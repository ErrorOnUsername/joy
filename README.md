# The Joy Programming Language

A language made for fun and to learn more about compilers


### Syntax
```
use joy.io;

decl main := () {
	io.println( "Hello, World!" );
};
```

### Progress

- [x] Lexing
- [x] Parsing (multithreaded)
- [ ] Typechecking (in-progress. multithreaded)
- [ ] Custom IR
- [ ] Custom backend (maybe also llvm just to learn? not sure)
- [ ] Metaprogramming
